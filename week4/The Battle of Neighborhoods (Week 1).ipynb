    "Thank's Coursera, I could finish my Data Science Course and I got a job in Toronto as a Data Scientist. The company offers me 60.000 CAD, along a simply online calculator I could get 45.000 CAD as net pay (after paying taxes). It sounds good and it means, I would earn 3750 CAD a month. Some experts say, you have to pay max. 1/3 of your net income for your renting, it means I could move into a flat, which renting price is max. 1250. Because I have to move move to Toronto, I should find the best location where I can live, paying my flat, going out or shopping etc. I'd like to feel myself as home, that's why I will looking a neighbourhood, which is quit similar to the place, where I live now. The criteries are:\n",
    "- Max renting price is 1250 CAD/month for a flat with minimum 1 bedrooms (if there are two bedrooms for that price, it would be also OK).\n",
    "- In that area should be some shopping centers, food stores etc. where I can buy my stuffs for living.\n",
    "- With my friends I'd like to going out, but I don't want to travel a lot for a bar or pub.\n",
    "- In summer I like to chill in a park, that's why I'd like to have a park nearby\n",
    "- It should be as close as possible to a subway station.\n"

    "With Foursquare I will collect some informations about the neighbourhoods: how many shopping centers, pubs, parks etc are in the area. I will choose the district with the highest diversity and hopefully there are some subway stations too."
